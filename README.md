# Truss-Finite-Element-Analysis
A bridge deck is modeled as a combination of bar and beam bending elements. The support is modeled as a standard truss. It is required that we write a code to analyze the structure, and to design the height of the deck and the cross-sectional areas of the truss to make the weight of the bridge as small as possible.
